                  <p>The thing that excites me about graphic design is not really graphic design itself, but communication. The process of language, understanding language, encoding language. This is something that constantly needs managing because it’s always changing. As soon as anything becomes a fixed in a pattern we tend to slip into not thinking about it critically. I’ve always been trying to challenge, rethink, or disrupt through graphic design. I’ve never wanted to find a comfortable place in all of this.</p>

                     <p>I like to think that good icons are instantly recognizable—even if someone's never seen it, you can ask them what it does, and they get it—or it's so easy to remember that if someone tells you what it is once, it's easy to remember when you look at it. I think that's a lot to ask of a symbol, that if you tested it everyone would all have the same one-word response as to its function.</p>

                  <p>What was often difficult for people to understand about the design was that there was nothing else beyond URLs, HTTP and HTML. There was no central computer "controlling" the Web, no single network on which these protocols worked, not even organisation anywhere that "ran" the Web. The Web was not a physical "thing" that existed in a certain "place". It was a "space" in which information could exist.</p>
